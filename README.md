# jQuery for commonly used w3-css
Here are some jQuery snippets for manipulating W3.css
W3Schools recently started offering a 'master' stylesheet to make responsive behaviors more predictible.  As the w3 community develops plug-ins and accessories, w3.css will overtake bootstrap as the most easily understood, semantic responsive framework for me.

Many thanks to w3schools.com
